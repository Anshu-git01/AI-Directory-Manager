# AI File Organizer

Welcome to **AI File Organizer**, a Java-based application that leverages automation and a simple machine learning approach to classify and organize files in a directory. This tool provides a user-friendly GUI to scan a selected folder, classify files based on their content or extension, and sort them into categorized subdirectories.

## Overview
This project automates file management by:
- Scanning directories recursively for files.
- Using an AI classifier to analyze file content (e.g., identifying code files).
- Organizing files into folders like `Images`, `Documents`, and `Code` based on predefined extensions.

## Features
- **GUI Interface:** Built with Java Swing for easy folder selection and real-time feedback.
- **File Classification:** Basic AI classifier that inspects file content (first line) to detect file types.
- **Automated Organization:** Moves files into appropriate subfolders based on their extensions.
- **Logging:** Displays scanning and organization progress in the GUI.
